It aims to simplify the teaching process of game AI courses, inspire learners to self-study, and acting as a dataset for game AI research. This platform is a universal online multi-agent game AI platform, designed to evaluate different implementations of game AI by applying them to agents in a variety of games and compete with each other, featuring an ELO ranking system and a contest system for users to evaluate their AI programs. It has been successfully used in various AI competitions and courses in practice, and has the extensibility to support more games and languages, as well as further usages such as studying machine learning on game AI. In this paper, we firstly describe the structure and features of Botzone, then focus on our experience in utilizing Botzone for a programming course.},
